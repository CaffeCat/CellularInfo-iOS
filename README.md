# CellularInfo-iOS

## Privacy Policy

Your privacy is our top priority. This app is backed by Apple's CloudKit service, which means the highest level of encryption. When any piece of information leaves your device, we REQUIRE you to review it before sending it. All of the data goes directly to CloudKit, without us having anything that can be used to identify you. We simply don't know anything other than those you chose to submit.

This app is open-source and available to download for free. Our company has no affiliation with any carrier or phone manufacturer around the globe.

## How to use the source code

The app depends heavily on Apple's CloudKit service, therefore expect no Plug-n-Play like experience. You should at least have an enrolled developer account to have access to CloudKit related functions.

However, it is welcome to copy snippets of code from this project and use them in your projects. This app wouldn't exist if it wasn't for the vibrant open source community that thankfully exists.

Apart from the open-source libraries I used in this project, everything else is licensed under CC-BY 4.0, meaning you can do whatever you want with it.

## Special Thanks to these open-source projects and their developers
